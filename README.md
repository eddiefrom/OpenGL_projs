# Older OpenGL projects with Visual Studio

Recreated collection of my older OpenGL projects in Visual Studio with freeglut.


## Initial steps 

Here is a step by step guide to achive our goal:

## Demo

### Cube
* The program using the GLUT library to create a 3D cube that can be rotated and zoomed using keyboard input. It includes transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation.


### Hermite Bezie
*  This program is to visualize a Bézier curve using Hermite interpolation. It allows users to interact with points by clicking and dragging them, and updates the Bézier curve accordingly.


### Background
* This code is a simple OpenGL program that creates a graphical interface where circles are drawn on a background split into four colored quadrants. The circles are animated and respond to mouse clicks to be placed within the quadrants, while the user can rotate the entire scene using the keyboard.


### Circle
* The program that displays a rotating polygon inscribed in a circle. The polygon’s shape (number of edges) can be adjusted using mouse clicks, and the circle and polygon both rotate when the left mouse button is pressed. The program demonstrates basic 2D graphics using OpenGL's GLUT library, and allows for interactivity through mouse input
